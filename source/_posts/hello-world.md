**[Dennis]**: “Alright, listen up! We’re writing a ‘Hello World’ post. It’s simple, elegant, and showcases my perfect... *syntax.* Now, I’m going to show you how a true professional greets the world: `print("Hello, World!")`. That’s class.”

**[Mac]**: “Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up, Dennis. That’s weak. We need some flair! Like, `echo 'HELLO, WORLD!'` in all caps because it’s more aggressive, you know? You want to dominate the console!”

**[Charlie]**: “Guys, guys, this is all wrong! You gotta go with ASCII art! Like, draw a cat and then it says ‘Hello World’ or something. I don’t know how to code, but I know cats, man!”

**[Dee]**: “Why are we even doing this? No one cares about a stupid ‘Hello World’ post! But if we *have* to, can I just write, ‘Hey, World! It’s Sweet Dee, deal with it!’?”

**[Frank]**: “I’m throwing some wildcard in here! Forget code, I’m just going to shout it: ‘HELLO WORLD! I’M FRANK REYNOLDS, AND I EAT TRASH!’”

**[Charlie]**: “You guys are missing the point! It’s all about a *message*, right? What if we use smoke signals or, like, rats? Train them to spell out ‘Hello World.’ Boom, everyone’s talking about us!”

**[Dennis]**: “Charlie, we’re writing a blog post, not training rats.”

**[Mac]**: “No, I like it! This is the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that’ll get us to the top of the cyber game!”

**[Dee]**: “You’re all idiots.”
